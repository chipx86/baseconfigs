setopt autolist         # List possible completions
setopt automenu         # But after that switch between possible
setopt nonomatch        # nomatch is stupid and should be shot
setopt nobeep           # beep is even worse and should be burned
setopt extended_glob    # Allow extended stuff in globs (yeah...)

#ulimit -c 0             # Disable core dumps
ulimit -c unlimited
